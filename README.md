# **Drum Beats**
A greenfoot version of [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/), [Taiko no Tatsujin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiko_no_Tatsujin) and [Beatmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatmania).

## Setup
This project uses Java 11.0.2+9 you can find the download link [here](https://jdk.java.net/archive/).

Since I need to use [Greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org/door) in my project, you need to download Greenfoot and just open the project.greenfoot in *src/main/java* and click the run button.

However, if you want to run the tests, or the game from the IDE, you will need to create a folder called libs on the project and copy greenfoot.jar (*GREENFOOT_INSTALLATION_PATH/lib/extentions*) and bluejcore.jar (*GREENFOOT_INSTALLATION_PATH/lib*) on it. ( I don't include then because you need Greenfoot anyways to run the game ).
